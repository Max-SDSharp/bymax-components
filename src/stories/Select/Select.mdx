# Select

<b>bymax React Select</b> is a component created using the [react-select](https://react-select.com) component, a flexible and beautiful select input control for ReactJS
with multiselect, singleselect and search system.

Customized to facilitate its use, it has an animation feature with its placeholder text which can be used as the title of the component and properties that help
in integration with the [formik](https://formik.org/) forms component.

The <b>bymax React Select</b> component was designed for use in forms that work with cryptocurrencies, but it was also developed to work with any type of data.
